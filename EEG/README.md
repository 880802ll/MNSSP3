# Epilepsy Detection
**Background:** EEG is an important tool to study the characteristics of epilepsy, which is a noninvasive biophysical examination method that can reflects more information than physiological methods. Deep learning is a very effective way to detect epilepsy based on EEG data. But deep learning can easily disclose user privacy because deep learning faces the white-box attacks and the black-box attacks. White-box attacks encroach the model by leaking internal parameters, while black box attacks refer to leaking data privacy through repeated queries. The build-in method of MNSSp3 called DPDL is used to solve the problem of privacy disclosure.  

**Method type:** build-in  

**Method name:** DPDL  

**usage:**   
* Step1ï¼šUser upload personal EEG data by clicking the [Upload File] button. The format template can be download through the link [Download test data].  
* Step2: Click the [test] button and wait about 5s, You can get the result in the Result box.

**Additional remarks:**       
* You can upload multiple people's EEG data at the same time through one file.
